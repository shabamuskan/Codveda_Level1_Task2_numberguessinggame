📌 Project Title: Number Guessing Game – CodVeda Task 2
🧠 Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly number guessing game built using Python. Developed as part of CodVeda Internship Task 2, the game challenges the player to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100 within 7 attempts.

It’s designed to strengthen basic programming logic, user input handling, and control flow understanding. The game provides real-time feedback like “Too low” or “Too high” and validates user input to ensure smooth gameplay.

🛠️ Features
🎲 Random number generation between 1 and 100

🔁 Limited to 7 attempts to guess correctly

✅ Input validation (prevents crashes from invalid input)

🧭 Real-time feedback ("Too low", "Too high")

📉 Attempt counter with remaining tries

📍 Final result message with the correct answer if the user fails

🔧 What I Learned
Implementing while loops and conditional statements

Handling exceptions using try-except

Building interactive console-based Python applications

Validating user input and improving UX in CLI apps

🚀 How to Run
Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Save the code in a file, e.g., guess_game.py.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Run the game:
bash

python guess_game.py
